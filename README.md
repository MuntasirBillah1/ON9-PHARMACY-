# ON9-PHARMACY-
On9 Pharmacy is an online platform where users can buy their medicine online without going to the pharmacy. There are two target users for our websites: patients and pharmacists. Patients can buy their medicine while pharmacists can manage their database through our website. This platform is an idea created for patients to buy medicine, especially during this pandemic, where we need to be constantly aware of our health. By using our platform, we can protect ourselves from Covid-19. It is always best practice not to expose ourselves in public during this pandemic. It is also for users to save time by just taking their purchase without waiting in the queue. This platform can help layers of society, such as housewives, the elderly, and oneself.  Patients need to register to our website before purchasing medicine. Then, patients can log in to our website and start buying the medicine. Based on the Malaysian Ministry of Health (KKM) policy, controlled medicine can only be bought at the pharmacy due to the risks of adverse effects especially if overdose. Thus, our website only provides Over the Counter (OTC) medicine where the user can just buy the medicine without getting a prescription from the pharmacist. They are safe and effective when used according to the directions on the label and as directed by the health care professional. The patient also can see their purchased history on our website.
